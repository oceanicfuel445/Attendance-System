# Attendance-System
The Smart Attendance System is an AI-powered solution that automates attendance using facial recognition. It captures faces via webcam, identifies registered users, and records their name, date, and time in an Excel sheet. This contactless system ensures fast, accurate, and secure attendance tracking, reducing errors and eliminating proxy marking.
